Tess Lameyer, Lisa Carpenter, Ian Andrewson, Alan Hermanns, Ben Beekman

## GOAL: 

## TECH STACK: 
Frameworks
-Node.js
-Python 

Database
- Mongoose/MongoDB on Heroku server



## HARDWARE: 




## Python: virtual environment, venv --> PIP needs its virutal environment to run; PyTest is a test environment for python 

## Raspberry Pi: 

-multiple pis/user ? 

- Specific kits: 
-shouldn't need virtual environment 
-how are we sending data from pi to server? HTTP requests (request library) to the express HTTP server on Heroku 

- vnc viewer (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/) as a way to visualize virtual environment for Python
