# Group Agreement

- We all agree to try to keep everyone speaking about the same amount so everyone is heard
- Create an environment that encourages clarification when there's a perceived disagreement.
- Disagreement is not necessarily conflict, and we see many disagreements as a tool to discuss different approaches. We'll all do our best to keep our egos out of disagreements, and remind ourselves that we all have the same goals of learning as much as we can from the experience and having a great final product.
- Using issue tracking, we'll be able to see what areas progress is not being made on. If someone seems stuck, we might suggest pair programming and/or issue clarification.
- If someone's really struggling with an issue, we'll ask them to work with someone who feels confident about a solution, or suggest they switch gears to an issue they feel confident they can tackle.
- If anyone sees a ticket that they don't feel confident about but want to work on, they should announce that at the beginning of the day and ask to pair with someone more confident in that area.
- Stretch goals will be something we will default to mob programming as they will be a challenge for any of us and we'll feel most confident about our success as a group.

## If someone is really not pulling their weight:

- We'll ensure that both people are talking about the same thing.
- We'll make sure everyone's being heard.
- If step 1 and step 2 are both confirmed, bring the agreement for resolution with the instructors.

## Communication Agreement

- We're planning on doing stand-up meetings at the beginning and end of the day as well as immediately after lunch.
- We've all expressed an interest in creating a group dynamic that encourages those who feel unheard to speak up, and we've all agreed that we'll take pains to address any concerns brought up by an individual.
- After-hours communication can take place on Slack, but we don't all have it notifying us at all times, so it can't be relied upon for immediate notification. This is fine, as long as we do a good job of communicating during regular hours.
- None of us have a problem with people staying late or coming early, and we don't all need to work during the exact same hours in order to make progress.
